    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>

    <h3>
        I have worked in a number of roles throughout my working career and I believe I have garnered a strong and desirable work ethic as a result of my many years of experience in a variety of fields.
        I have worked primarily in roles involving customer service and I believe that this is reflected in my ability to conversate with customers and am more than happy to tend to their every need and to ensure they receive the highest of level of customer service possible.
        My other jobs have involved labour strenuous activites, such as, working on a National Trust Estate ensuring that the estate was maintained at the highest standards possible, and also as a grass-cutter for my local neighbourhood.
        As a result, I feel that I could make a positive impact on any working environment I am presented and would like to think that I would fit in easily thanks to my strong social skills.

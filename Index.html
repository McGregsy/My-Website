    <h1>Some Incoherrent Babble..</h1>

    <h3>I have always  been interested in computers and since a young age I have seemed to have had a natural ability to handle them and to overcome issues and troubleshooting.
        As a result, I have had much experience in dealing with hardware and software problems related to computing.
        This is likely what led me to do a computing course to advance my knowledge on the subject and to turn my hobby into a profitable skill.
        I am an avid listener to music (see my generic playlist on the right).  I thoroughly enjoy almost all types of music (definitely not opera though).
        I also love driving, which is useful as I live 50 miles away from everything.  My car is my life and I am currently planning to change the colours and lights to make it more exciting and more personal.
        Socialising plays a large part in my life (a computing student who enjoys socialising, who knew!).  Spending time with my friends is something that I will never tire of and I believe that you will never be happy unless you enjoy the company of those who are closest to you.
        Finally, my job is a surpisingly large chunk of what makes me happy in general right now. It is really nice to be able to go to work and just switch off from the outside world and its stresses and just work for hours on end.</h3>
